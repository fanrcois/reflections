Make changes on GitHub

Now that you've seen how to create a remote repository and push changes to it, use the GitHub website to create a new file for your lesson 3 reflections and add the below question and your thoughts on it.

If you prefer to start from the file lesson_3_reflection_prompts.txt in the Downloadables section, you can download that file, commit it locally, push to GitHub, then add your response using the GitHub website.
Reflect: Using a remote repository

Use the following reflection prompt:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're finished committing your changes, click "Next" to see how to pull those changes to your own computer.



Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull

Now that you've both pushed changes to GitHub, and pulled changes from GitHub, add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next" and Sarah will go over what to do if you want to share your changes to a repository and you don't have permission to modify the original.



Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Now that you've seen how you can make a copy of a repository on GitHub by forking it, go add the the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next".
